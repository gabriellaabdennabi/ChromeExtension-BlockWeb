# Momentum Clone
## Overview
This project is based on the Momentum google chrome extension. Its a customized page that replaces the new tab homepage. Momentum is a personal productivity app that provides the user with the space to define their goals for the day, gives access to a todo app, stores links for easy access amongst other features. The purpose is to keep the user on task.

I wanted to recreate the extension in order to better improve my skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I am recreating the following features and adding new ones:

* Todo list feature
* Time Check
* Random Quote 
* Random Image
* Pomodoro
* Notes feature
